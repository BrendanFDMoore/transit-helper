# When Is My Train? A transit helper.

This is an app I intend to use to enable easy access to some simplified transit schedules. The initial use case was to restore online access to some "mini" schedules available per station by my local commuter rail operator in the Greater Toronto Area. These were remove during a website refresh, and can no longer be found.

See it online at [WhenIsMyTrain.info](http://whenismytrain.info).

## Built with

* React (via [Create React App](https://github.com/facebookincubator/create-react-app))
* Rebass
* styled-components
* Images from Unsplash

## TODO

* Load remaining stations
* Better images
* Consider parsing timetables into text/data for accessibility
* Set up mailing list for update notifications by line or station
* Bookmarkable station pages with more details (transit operator site breaks on inbound links...)
* Live departures if API is available
