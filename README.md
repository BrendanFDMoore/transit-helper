# When Is My Train? A transit helper.

This is an app I intend to use to enable easy access to some simplified transit schedules. The initial use case was to restore easy online access to some "mini" schedules available per station by my local commuter rail operator in the Greater Toronto Area. These were made significantly less discoverable during a website refresh, and are no longer surfaced by a Google search.

I built this to meet a need and fix a frustration I was facing as a GO Train rider. I hope that it also helps other riders.

See it online at [WhenIsMyTrain.info](https://whenismytrain.info).
